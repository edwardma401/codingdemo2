    There are many methods in brewing a coffee. You could use a machine, use french press, or just enjoy simple mixed coffee. If you are a person who values convenience, mixed coffee
    would be the best option. If you are a person who loves the rich smell of coffee in a mouthful of coffee and willing to get your hands wet, french press can be the better option.
